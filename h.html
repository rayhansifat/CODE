            <p>We enjoyed a much needed day off on Thursday, enjoying the luxury of
                the Alila hotel, with its stunning views over the mountains. It sits
                on a promontory of rock with deep gorges on either side, and has
                been built from local stone to blend into the landscape. We did the
                one hour nature walk but opted not to do the 5km walk in the local
                area!</p>

            <p>After that, it was a 3 hour drive to visit a very scenic wadi. Except
                that when we got to within 5km, we found the road was closed
                following a landslide. Damm! We turned around and retraced our
                steps, stopping at a popular local restaurant for lunch. It was
                heaving with people, as this is a 3 day holiday weekend when people
                go back to their villages. Rather than a big open space with tables,
                chipboard partitions had been built to create a series of separate
                dining areas. The ones around the edge had tables and chairs, the
                ones in the middle were for those who wanted to sit on the floor in
                a circle in big family groups. No prizes for guessing which we
                chose! We enjoyed camel meat and chicken with pilau rice, once more
                in massive quantities that we could not possibly finish.</p>
